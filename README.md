# Data-Analysis-Housing-Assignment
This is the final assignment of the Data Analysis with Python course offered by IBM through Coursera.

Unfortunately, I was unable to access Watson Studio to complete this assignment.
Since the staff never responded to my discussion threads, I decided to download the data from
an independent source and complete the assignment locally.
Consequently, my code is available as both a .py file and a .ipynb file.
